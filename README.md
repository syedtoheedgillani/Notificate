**Notificate Plugin for Moodle**

The Notificate plugin is a powerful notification tool designed to enhance engagement and accountability within the Moodle Learning Management System. With its automated email notifications, Notificate keeps students informed about pending course activities and empowers administrators to intervene when necessary to support student progress.

**Key Features:**

- **Activity-Based Notifications:** Notificate sends automated email notifications to students based on their activity completion status within courses. These notifications serve as reminders to encourage timely completion of course activities.

- **Gradual Reminder System:** If a student fails to complete an activity, Notificate sends reminders at three intervals, spaced four days apart. This gradual approach aims to gently prompt students to take action without overwhelming them with excessive notifications.

- **Admin Alert System:** If a student still hasn't completed the activity after three reminders, Notificate triggers an alert to the site administrator. This alert includes the student's username, email address, as well as links to the course and specific activity, enabling administrators to follow up directly with the student.

**Benefits:**

- **Promotes Accountability:** By sending timely reminders, Notificate encourages students to stay on track with their course activities, fostering a sense of accountability for their learning progress.

- **Supports Student Success:** The gradual reminder system strikes a balance between prompting students to take action and respecting their autonomy, thereby supporting student success without causing undue stress.

- **Facilitates Intervention:** The admin alert system equips administrators with the information they need to intervene effectively when students require additional support or guidance, ultimately improving student outcomes.

- **Streamlines Communication:** Notificate streamlines communication between students and administrators, facilitating proactive engagement and fostering a supportive learning environment.
